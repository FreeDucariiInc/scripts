## Pull request guide

You may create a pull request if you wish to contribute scripts or changes otherwise, provided you follow a couple of rules.

1. Do not touch other people's scripts without the approval of the author / co-authors. Improvements to scripts are allowed but you **MUST** ask for permission first.
2. You **MUST** create a folder for your own script, do not put more than one script in one folder.
3. In said folder, make a [README.md](example/example%20lua/readme.md), based on the template.
4. Do not upload obfuscated / malicious luas.
5. Do not upload meaningless scripts (as judged by the community).
6. Do not upload other people's scripts for them.
7. Modify the lua index, after adding your lua.

You may find the template to follow in [example](example/example%20lua/)
You must change the information in it accordingly.

## Open source license

You may choose your own open source license instead of the default MIT license by putting your own LICENSE file under your script's directory.
