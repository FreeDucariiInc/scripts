Anyone is welcome to contribute, as long as they follow the [Pull request guide](#pull-request-guide)

## Pull request guide {#pull-request-guide}

You may create a pull request if you wish to contribute scripts or changes otherwise, provided you follow a couple of rules.

1. Do not touch other people's scripts.
2. You **MUST** create a folder for your own script.
3. In said folder, make a [README.md](example/example%20lua/readme.md), based on the template.
4. Do not upload obfuscated / malicious luas.

You may find the template to follow in [example](example/example%20lua/)
You must change the information in it accordingly.
